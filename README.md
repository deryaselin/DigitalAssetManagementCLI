# DigitalAssetManagementCLI

This project is a command-line interface application developed in Java to facilitate efficient management of digital assets. It encompasses key features such as asset indexing, metadata management, and search capabilities, serving to the needs of organizations dealing with a large volume of assets.The project was developed using the TDD approach, ensuring reliability through rigorous testing. Creating this project was a significant challenge for me, considering my relatively new journey into coding. However, I dedicated a substantial amount of time to studying and understanding the intricacies of Java programming, testing methodologies like TDD. As a newcomer, grasping such methodologies required intensive learning and practice. I delved into Java's object-oriented principles, learned about libraries like Apache Commons CLI. This project served as an invaluable learning experience, showcasing my dedication to mastering new technologies and overcoming obstacles along the way. It's a testament to the power of persistence and continuous learning in the world of software development.
